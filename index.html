      <p>Last week, I streamed <span class="data-point" id="author-streaming-hours">20</span> hours of videos on Netflix, 
        YouTube, and Canvas. I performed <span class="data-point" id="author-ai-queries">50</span> ChatGPT queries and 
        <span class="data-point" id="author-search-requests">532</span> Google searches. I sent <span class="data-point" id="author-emails-sent">25</span> 
        emails and <span class="data-point" id="author-messages-sent">325</span> WhatsApp messages. Behind my screens, it did 
        not feel like I was producing greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, the environmental footprint of 
        my online activity was real—it amounted to <span class="data-point" id="author-weekly-emissions">1,447</span> grams of CO₂ 
        equivalents, broken down as follows:

      <p>Over a year, this would amount to approximately <span class="data-point" id="author-yearly-emissions">75</span> kilograms 
        of CO₂ equivalents. For reference, this represents the same amount of emissions as any of the following:</p>

      <p>If those numbers do not seem significant in absolute, we need to keep in mind
        that they are for a single individual. To better appreciate what they represent
        on a global scale, we should consider the total number of internet users, which
        grew from <span class="data-point">414</span> million in 2000 to <span class="data-point">5.52</span> billion in 2024:</p>
