      <p>Last week, I streamed <span class="data-point" id="author-streaming-hours">20</span> hours of videos on Netflix, 
        YouTube, and Canvas. I performed <span class="data-point" id="author-ai-queries">50</span> ChatGPT queries and 
        <span class="data-point" id="author-search-requests">532</span> Google searches. I sent <span class="data-point" id="author-emails-sent">25</span> 
        emails and <span class="data-point" id="author-messages-sent">325</span> WhatsApp messages. Behind my screens, it did 
        not feel like I was producing greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, the environmental footprint of 
        my online activity was real—it amounted to <span class="data-point" id="author-weekly-emissions">1,447</span> grams of CO₂ 
        equivalents, broken down as follows:

      <p>Over a year, this would amount to approximately <span class="data-point" id="author-yearly-emissions">75</span> kilograms 
        of CO₂ equivalents. For reference, this represents the same amount of emissions as any of the following:</p>

      <p>If those numbers do not seem significant in absolute, we need to keep in mind
        that they are for a single individual. To better appreciate what they represent
        on a global scale, we should consider the total number of internet users, which
        grew from <span class="data-point">414</span> million in 2000 to <span class="data-point">5.52</span> billion in 2024:</p>

      <p>The growth of internet users has been quite liner between 2000 and 2020,
        and seems to be slowing down. This may be due to the fact that a large part
        of the world population is already connected to the internet. As we near
        a 100% global internet penetration, we should expect the growth to keep slowing
        down. One question that arises is how the internet traffic of all these users
        has evolved over time. The chart below allows you to make a guess about this growth:</p>

      <p>Now that you've seen how internet traffic has grown over the years, you may be wondering how that
        has influenced the electricity consumption of the web. The chart below shows the evolution of the
        electricity consumption of the internet, and in comparison to the member countries of the G20. In
        other words, this shows how much power the internet would consume if it were a country:></p>
