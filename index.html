      <p>Last week, I streamed <span class="data-point" id="author-streaming-hours">20</span> hours of videos on Netflix,

        not feel like I was contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, the environmental impact of 
        my online activity was real—it amounted to <span class="data-point" id="author-weekly-emissions">1,447</span> grams of CO₂

      <h2>The Internet Is Growing Fast</h2>
      <p>Between 2000 and 2024, the number of internet users has grown from <span class="data-point">414</span> 
        million to <span class="data-point">5.52</span> billion:</p>

    <section class="text-block">
      <p>This growth has been remarkably steady, with a mostly linear increase from 2000 to 2020. However, 
        it now appears to be slowing. This is likely because a significant portion of the global population 
        is already online. As we approach full global internet penetration, it is reasonable to expect the 
        rate of growth to continue slowing.</p>

      <h2>Energy Consumption and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Are On The Rise</h2>
      <p>Now that we have explored the rapid growth of internet traffic, you might wonder how this 
        has impacted the internet’s electricity consumption. The chart below compares the internet’s 
        energy use over time to that of G20 member countries, illustrating how the internet would rank 
        if it were a country:</p>

    </section>
    <section class="text-block">
      <p>Between 2010 and 2022, the internet’s electricity consumption increased nearly tenfold, 
        rising from 83 TWh to 788 TWh—a staggering 20.63% compound annual growth rate. By 2022, 
        the internet consumed more electricity than 14 G20 countries, including Brazil and Germany, 
        and was only outpaced by China, the United States, India, Russia, and Japan.</p>
      <p>Looking ahead, the trend shows no sign of slowing.  
        <a href="https://thundersaidenergy.com/2023/04/20/what-is-the-energy-consumption-of-the-internet/">Thunder Said Energy</a> 
        projects that by 2030, the internet’s electricity consumption will reach 2,000 TWh, 
        and by 2050, it could climb to 3,750 TWh. If these forecasts hold true, the internet alone would 
        account for 5% to 7% of global electricity use—a remarkable share for something so integral to modern life.
        What does this mean in terms of CO₂ emissions?</p>
      <p> While the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector is often highly praised for enabling 
        efficiencies that help reduce other sector's footprint, it receives little attention as a contributor 
        to those emissions. The charts below shows the evolution of the ICT sector's CO₂ emissions:</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095965261733233X">Belkhir and Elmeligi</a>, 
        between 2007 and 2020, the ICT sector’s share of global emissions more than doubled, rising from an estimated 1.06%-1.6% in 2007 
        to 3.06%-3.6% in 2020. This reflects the world’s increasing reliance on digital technology and infrastructure.</p>
      <p>By 2040, Belkhir and Elmeligi estimate that the ICT sector’s share of the global carbon footprint could range from 5.82% 
        under a linear trend to 14.57% if growth follows an exponential trajectory. Under that exponential scenario, ICT emissions would surpass 
        the relative footprint of agriculture (9%) and approach half the current footprint of the industrial sector (29%) in the United States. 
        These estimates assume global emissions stabilize at 2015 levels, in line with the Paris Agreement.</p>
        <p>If the exponential trend prevails, the ICT sector will become one of the largest contributors to global emissions. <span class="important-statement">This is the curve we want to bend.</span></p>

      <h2>Where Are Emissions Coming From?</h2>
      <p>To bend the curve of emissions from the ICT sector, we first need to understand what is causing 
        these emissions. Estimates of emissions in the ICT sector vary according to methodology, but experts converge 
        towards the idea that the main sources of emissions are user devices, networks, and data centers.</p>
      <p>These three pillars of modern digital ecosystems interact to deliver digital services, enabling data 
        transmission and processing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>User devices (e.g., smartphones, laptops) serve as endpoints for accessing and consuming content, 
          running applications, and interacting with services. They consume energy primarily for processing, 
          storage, and display, with emissions depending on their energy source.</li>
        <li>Networks, comprising wired and wireless infrastructure like fiber optics, routers, and cellular towers, 
          transmit data between devices and data centers. They consume energy for signal transmission and maintaining 
          connectivity, with emissions varying by network efficiency and energy grid.</li>
        <li>Data centers process, store, and manage vast amounts of data, consuming energy for computation, storage, 
          and cooling, often producing significant emissions if powered by non-renewable energy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><a href="https://www.cell.com/patterns/pdfExtended/S2666-3899(21)00188-4">Andrae and Edler</a> estimate ICT emissions to be distributed as follows: </p>

      <!-- Emissions breakdown chart will be inserted here -->
    </section>
    <section class="text-block">
      <p>Within each segment, we need to distinguish between two categories of emissions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Embodied emissions refer to the greenhouse gases produced during the manufacturing, transportation, and 
          installation of digital hardware, such as servers, devices, and network equipment.</li>
        <li>Operational emissions are generated during the daily use of digital systems, including powering data centers, 
          networks, and user devices.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>According to the Sustainable Web Design Model, emissions are distributed as follows:</p>

      <p>As the chart above suggests, addressing embodied emissions is crucial, as these emissions are essentially "built into" 
        the physical infrastructure before it is used. As this pertains to the field of hardware manufacturing, it is outside 
        the direct scope of this article.</p>
        <p>In sustainable computing and software engineering, the focus is often on 
        reducing operational emissions because they are directly influenced by how we design, develop, and optimize 
        software and systems—such as improving energy efficiency, minimizing data transfer, and utilizing green energy 
        sources. Let's examine how we can decrease operational emission contributions of user devices, networks, and data 
        centers.</p>

      <h2>The Promise of Renewable Energy</h2>
      <p>One of the main sources of operational emissions in the ICT sector is the energy consumption of data centers. One way to
        reduce the emissions of data centers is to power them with renewable energy sources. Fortunately, the trend
        is already moving in this direction. The largest cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud,
        and Microsoft Azure, have committed to powering their data centers with <a href="https://www.cedara.io/post/tracking-the-transition-to-renewable-energy-in-the-data-center-industry">100%</a> 
        renewable energy between 2025 and 2030.</p>
        <p>In 2020, AWS reached <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/energy/transition1/">65%</a> of 
          renewable energy usage, and as of 2023, the company was matching 
          <a href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/products-services/aws-cloud">100%</a> of its electricity consumption 
          with renewable energy sources. Amazon is aiming to operate their data centers with 
          <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/migration-and-modernization/embracing-modernization-with-a-sustainability-focus/">100%</a> 
          renewable energy by 2025, with a target for net-zero status by 2040.</p>
        <p>Google's data centers have been <a href="https://sustainability.google/reports/environmental-report-2018/#renewable-energy">carbon neutral</a> 
          since 2007 and the company has been matching <a href="https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/cleanenergy/">100%</a> 
          of its annual electricity consumption with renewable energy purchases since 2017. Between 2019 and 2020,
          the share of renewable energy in Google's global electricity consumption increased from 61% to 
          <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/sustainability/the-year-in-carbon-free-energy-at-google">67%</a>.</p>
        <p>Microsoft's data centers have been <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/5/2018/04/MSFT.Map_.Final_3_28_18.pdf">carbon neutral</a>
            since 2012, and were relying on 50% renewable energy by 2018. By 2050, the company ambitions to remove from the atmosphere
            <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/sustainability-journey">all the carbon</a> it has emitted since its founding in 1975.</p>
        <p>Until all data centers are completely powered by renewable energy, sustainable software engineering practices
          can help product development teams maximize the reliance of the cloud applications they build on renewable energy sources.
          To that effect, the Linux Foundation's <a href="https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/green-software-for-practitioners-lfc131/">Green Software for Practitioners</a>
          certification advocates two fundamental approaches to make software do more when the carbon intensity of computing is lower.</p> 
        <p><strong>Demand shifting</strong>, on the one hand, involves rescheduling or relocating computational tasks to take advantage of lower carbon 
          intensity at different times or locations. This strategy can be broken down into two types: spatial shifting and temporal 
          shifting. Spatial shifting means moving computations to regions where energy is cleaner, such as data centers powered by 
          renewable energy. Temporal shifting involves delaying tasks to times when the grid is less carbon-intensive, such as during 
          sunny or windy periods. For example, training machine learning models at night when wind energy is abundant or relocating workloads 
          to another hemisphere during peak solar seasons are both examples of demand shifting.</p>
        <p><strong>Demand shaping</strong>, on the other hand, refers to adapting computational workloads to align with the availability of low-carbon energy sources. 
          Instead of moving tasks to a different time or location, demand shaping involves increasing or decreasing application activities in 
          response to the current carbon intensity of the electricity grid. For instance, when the grid is powered predominantly by renewable energy, 
          applications can scale up and perform more energy-intensive tasks. Conversely, during periods of higher carbon intensity, applications can reduce 
          demand or prioritize essential processes. Examples of demand shaping include video conferencing software that adjusts streaming quality based on bandwidth 
          or energy efficiency, and eco modes in applications that sacrifice performance to reduce energy consumption automatically or with user consent.</p>

      <h2>Efficiency, The Cornerstone of Sustainability</h2>
      <p>Even if the entire ICT sector were powered by renewable energy, the industry’s exponential growth 
        means efficiency would still be critical. Without significant improvements in how energy is used, 
        the sector risks consuming an outsized share of clean energy resources that are also essential for 
        other sectors and societal needs.</p>
        <p>Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) is a key metric used to measure data center energy efficiency. 
          Developed by Green Grid in 2006, PUE compares the total energy consumption of a data center to the energy 
          used solely by its computing equipment. A PUE of 1.0 indicates that all energy is used for computing, 
          with no additional overhead for cooling or power distribution. For instance, if an application consumes 10 kWh 
          of energy and the data center’s PUE is 1.5, the actual energy drawn from the grid is 15 kWh—10 kWh for computing 
          and 5 kWh for operational overhead like cooling and power delivery.</p>
          <p>Fortunately, PUE has improved significantly over the years. In 2007, the global average PUE was around 2.5, 
            meaning that data centers consumed 1.5 watts in overhead for every watt used by computing equipment. By 2020, 
            global PUE had dropped to under 1.6, thanks to advancements in IT hardware, more efficient cooling technologies, 
            and a shift towards hyperscale cloud data centers that are far more efficient than smaller enterprise facilities. 
            This progress has been instrumental in keeping global data center electricity consumption relatively flat despite 
            the exponential growth of internet traffic and workloads. For example, while internet traffic grew by a factor of 
            20 between 2010 and 2020, data center electricity use only increased moderately, stabilizing at an estimated 
            240-340 TWh in 2022, or roughly 1-1.3% of global electricity demand.</p>
          <p>To understand the impact of PUE on energy consumption more deeply, explore the interactive charts below. The first chart 
            illustrates the worldwide average annual PUE of data centers from 2010 to 2050, while the second shows global data center 
            electricity consumption over the same period. By adjusting the PUE values in the first chart, you can see how future efficiency 
            improvements could shape energy consumption in the coming decades. These visualizations highlight both the achievements made 
            so far and the potential for further efficiency gains as the ICT sector continues to grow.</p>

      <p>These charts clearly highlight the critical importance of further reducing PUE over the long term to limit energy consumption as the ICT sector 
        continues to grow. To achieve this, let's consider the factors that influence PUE, including how data centers manage energy-intensive processes 
        like cooling.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="text-block">
      <hr>
      <h2>Taking The Heat—And Giving It Back</h2>
      <p>At its core, a data center functions as a vast collection of information processing engines—servers—designed to perform complex computational tasks. 
        Each server takes in electromagnetic energy as electricity, which powers its operations. This energy is then transformed into two outputs: 
        information processing, the intended result, and heat energy, an inevitable byproduct. The illustration below demonstrates this process:</p>
      <img src="assets/images/information_processing_engine.svg" alt="Information processing Engine">
      <p>Innovation in overhead efficiency, particularly in cooling systems, plays a critical role in improving PUE by ensuring a larger proportion 
        of a data center's energy consumption is allocated to computing rather than managing heat. Cutting-edge solutions such as advanced liquid cooling, 
        optimized airflow designs, and energy-efficient pumps have already demonstrated their potential to reduce cooling demands significantly. For instance, 
        technologies like immersion cooling eliminate the need for traditional air conditioning, while heat recapture systems transform waste heat into a resource. 
        As organizations aim to lower their PUE, such innovations represent a vital path forward for sustainable operations.</p>
      <p>But what about the heat that data centers inevitably produce? Waste heat, rather than being discarded, can become a valuable resource. For instance, 
        data centers can <a href="https://www.iea.org/energy-system/buildings/data-centres-and-data-transmission-networks">repurpose excess heat</a> to warm nearby 
        residential or commercial buildings or support industrial processes, reducing reliance on other energy sources. 
        If implemented effectively, waste heat management could even contribute to a dramatic reduction in Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE). In theory, a data center that makes 
        full use of its waste heat could achieve a PUE below 1.0, as the energy consumed would serve dual purposes: powering computing operations and providing useful heat for 
        external needs. This underscores the transformative potential of waste heat as a key element in building more sustainable digital infrastructure.</p>
      <p>Looking beyond hardware, optimizing the software that powers data centers offers another critical avenue for improvement. Rust, for example, is a programming 
        language known for its efficiency, with <a href="https://greenlab.di.uminho.pt/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sleFinal.pdf">studies</a> showing it can halve electricity 
        consumption compared to Java, a common language in cloud computing. Shane Miller, 
        a leader in the Rust community, notes that this level of efficiency could enable <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/02/14/1067869/rust-worlds-fastest-growing-programming-language/">smaller data centers</a> 
        capable of handling the same workloads as larger ones.</p>
      <p>This creates a dual opportunity: by locating these mini data centers in urban areas—such as in the basements of residential or commercial buildings—they may be positioned closer to both heat consumers 
        and data consumers. This proximity allows for more practical reuse of waste heat, while also reducing the network footprint—by minimizing the resources required to transmit 
        heat and data, respectively, over long distances. These combined benefits underscore the transformative potential of sustainable software practices in addressing energy challenges.</p>

      <h2>The Immense Power of Sustainable Software Engineering</h2>
      <p>In February 2020, Danny Van Kooten published a <a href="https://www.dannyvankooten.com/blog/2020/website-carbon-emissions/">blog post</a> 
        sharing how a simple decision in sustainable web design led to remarkable environmental benefits. As a software developer, 
        he optimized his WordPress plugin to remove unnecessary JavaScript, reducing the data transferred with every page load on his website.</p>
      <p>This seemingly minor change had a significant impact: by shrinking the size of his site, he cut energy consumption for visitors, 
        leading to an estimated reduction of over 59,000 kilograms of CO2 emissions annually—equivalent to 85 transatlantic flights 
        from New York to Amsterdam. Van Kooten’s story demonstrates how thoughtful design choices can create substantial environmental gains, 
        offering a compelling model for building greener digital systems.</p>
      <p>Van Kooten’s approach reflects broader principles of sustainable web design, which focus on minimizing the energy and resources required to build, 
        run, and access digital services. Experts like Tom Greenwood, Tim Frick, and Anne Currie, among others, have outlined key practices for designing 
        sustainable digital systems:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Prioritize simplicity and efficiency: Reduce unnecessary features, files, and code to minimize energy consumption.</li>
        <li>Design for performance: Optimize load times and minimize data transfer, ensuring that digital assets consume fewer resources.</li>
        <li>Leverage green hosting: Choose hosting providers powered by renewable energy to reduce operational emissions.</li>
        <li>Adopt user-centric sustainability: Build interfaces and features that encourage environmentally conscious behavior.</li>
        <li>Extend system lifespans: Design software and digital tools to last longer and reduce the need for frequent upgrades.</li>
        <li>Measure and optimize continuously: Use tools to measure the environmental impact of your digital services and identify areas for improvement.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For individuals and organizations, tools like Website Carbon and EcoGrader offer a practical way to assess the sustainability of any website. By analyzing 
        factors like data transfer size, hosting energy source, and user traffic, these tools provide actionable insights to help you reduce your digital carbon footprint.</p>
      <p>The potential impact of sustainable software engineering becomes staggering when scaled across major organizations. Consider the websites of Fortune 500 companies,

      <h2>The Mirage of Digital Sobriety</h2>
      <p>Digital sobriety—the notion that reducing digital technology usage can significantly curb its environmental impact—overlooks 
        the profound connection between digital adoption and human progress. Strong correlations between metrics like the number of data 
        centers, internet connection speeds, and internet users with indicators such as the Human Development Index (HDI) and Gross Domestic 
        Product (GDP) underscore the transformative role of digital access in improving well-being and prosperity. Asking end users or developing 
        nations to scale back their usage not only risks stifling opportunities for knowledge and economic growth but also ignores the root problem: 
        the environmental footprint of computing lies primarily in how technology is produced, powered, and maintained. The solution, therefore, 
        is not to limit access but to accelerate the transition to cleaner, more efficient computing infrastructure that can sustainably meet the demand, 
        ensuring everyone can enjoy the immense benefits of the digital era.</p>
