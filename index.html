      <p>Last week, I streamed <span class="data-point" id="author-streaming-hours">20</span> hours of videos on Netflix, 
        YouTube, and Canvas. I asked ChatGPT <span class="data-point" id="author-ai-queries">50</span> questions and 
        made <span class="data-point" id="author-search-requests">532</span> Google searches. I sent <span class="data-point" id="author-emails-sent">25</span> 
        emails and <span class="data-point" id="author-messages-sent">325</span> messages on WhatsApp. From behind my screens, it did 
        not feel like I was contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, the environmental impact of 
        my online activity was real—it amounted to <span class="data-point" id="author-weekly-emissions">1,447</span> grams of CO₂ 
        equivalents, distributed as follows:

      <p>The key takeaway is that digital activities have a carbon footprint, however small. When scaled across 
        billions of people, even tiny amounts can add up to something enormous. This is especially true for digital 
        technology, given the rapid and relentless growth of the internet.</p>

      <h2>The Internet Is Growing Fast</h2>
      <p>Between 2000 and 2024, the number of internet users has grown from <span class="data-point">414</span> 
        million to <span class="data-point">5.52</span> billion:</p>

      <!-- Internet users chart will be inserted here -->
    </section>
    <section class="text-block">
      <p>This growth has been remarkably steady, with a mostly linear increase from 2000 to 2020. However, 
        it now appears to be slowing. This is likely because a significant portion of the global population 
        is already online. As we approach full global internet penetration, it is reasonable to expect the 
        rate of growth to continue slowing.</p>
      <p>What about internet traffic? How has the volume of data generated and consumed by all these users 
        changed over time? Take a look at the chart below and make your best guess:</p>

      <h2>Energy Consumption and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Are On The Rise</h2>
      <p>Now that we have explored the rapid growth of internet traffic, you might wonder how this 
        has impacted the internet’s electricity consumption. The chart below compares the internet’s 
        energy use over time to that of G20 member countries, illustrating how the internet would rank 
        if it were a country:</p>

    </section>
    <section class="text-block">
      <p>Between 2010 and 2022, the internet’s electricity consumption increased nearly tenfold, 
        rising from 83 TWh to 788 TWh—a staggering 20.63% compound annual growth rate. By 2022, 
        the internet consumed more electricity than 14 G20 countries, including Brazil and Germany, 
        and was only outpaced by China, the United States, India, Russia, and Japan.</p>
      <p>Looking ahead, the trend shows no sign of slowing.  
        <a href="https://thundersaidenergy.com/2023/04/20/what-is-the-energy-consumption-of-the-internet/">Thunder Said Energy</a> 
        projects that by 2030, the internet’s electricity consumption will reach 2,000 TWh, 
        and by 2050, it could climb to 3,750 TWh. If these forecasts hold true, the internet alone would 
        account for 5% to 7% of global electricity use—a remarkable share for something so integral to modern life.
        What does this mean in terms of CO₂ emissions?</p>
      <p> While the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector is often highly praised for enabling 
        efficiencies that help reduce other sector's footprint, it receives little attention as a contributor 
        to those emissions. The charts below shows the evolution of the ICT sector's CO₂ emissions:</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095965261733233X">Belkhir and Elmeligi</a>, 
        between 2007 and 2020, the ICT sector’s share of global emissions more than doubled, rising from an estimated 1.06%-1.6% in 2007 
        to 3.06%-3.6% in 2020. This reflects the world’s increasing reliance on digital technology and infrastructure.</p>
      <p>By 2040, Belkhir and Elmeligi estimate that the ICT sector’s share of the global carbon footprint could range from 5.82% 
        under a linear trend to 14.57% if growth follows an exponential trajectory. Under that exponential scenario, ICT emissions would surpass 
        the relative footprint of agriculture (9%) and approach half the current footprint of the industrial sector (29%) in the United States. 
        These estimates assume global emissions stabilize at 2015 levels, in line with the Paris Agreement.</p>
        <p>If the exponential trend prevails, the ICT sector will become one of the largest contributors to global emissions. <span class="important-statement">This is the curve we want to bend.</span></p>

      <h2>Where Are Emissions Coming From?</h2>
      <p>To bend the curve of emissions from the ICT sector, we first need to understand what is causing 
        these emissions. Estimates of emissions in the ICT sector vary according to methodology, but experts converge 
        towards the idea that the main sources of emissions are user devices, networks, and data centers.</p>
      <p>These three pillars of modern digital ecosystems interact to deliver digital services, enabling data 
        transmission and processing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>User devices (e.g., smartphones, laptops) serve as endpoints for accessing and consuming content, 
          running applications, and interacting with services. They consume energy primarily for processing, 
          storage, and display, with emissions depending on their energy source.</li>
        <li>Networks, comprising wired and wireless infrastructure like fiber optics, routers, and cellular towers, 
          transmit data between devices and data centers. They consume energy for signal transmission and maintaining 
          connectivity, with emissions varying by network efficiency and energy grid.</li>
        <li>Data centers process, store, and manage vast amounts of data, consuming energy for computation, storage, 
          and cooling, often producing significant emissions if powered by non-renewable energy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><a href="https://www.cell.com/patterns/pdfExtended/S2666-3899(21)00188-4">Andrae and Edler</a> estimate ICT emissions to be distributed as follows: </p>

      <!-- Emissions breakdown chart will be inserted here -->
    </section>
    <section class="text-block">
      <p>Within each segment, we need to distinguish between two categories of emissions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Embodied emissions refer to the greenhouse gases produced during the manufacturing, transportation, and 
          installation of digital hardware, such as servers, devices, and network equipment.</li>
        <li>Operational emissions are generated during the daily use of digital systems, including powering data centers, 
          networks, and user devices.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>According to the Sustainable Web Design Model, emissions are distributed as follows:</p>

      <p>As the chart above suggests, addressing embodied emissions is crucial, as these emissions are essentially "built into" 
        the physical infrastructure before it is used. As this pertains to the field of hardware manufacturing, it is outside 
        the direct scope of this article.</p>
        <p>In sustainable computing and software engineering, the focus is often on 
        reducing operational emissions because they are directly influenced by how we design, develop, and optimize 
        software and systems—such as improving energy efficiency, minimizing data transfer, and utilizing green energy 
        sources. Let's examine how we can decrease operational emission contributions of user devices, networks, and data 
        centers.</p>

      <h2>The Promise of Renewable Energy</h2>
      <p>One of the main sources of operational emissions in the ICT sector is the energy consumption of data centers. One way to
        reduce the emissions of data centers is to power them with renewable energy sources. Fortunately, the trend
        is already moving in this direction. The largest cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud,
        and Microsoft Azure, have committed to powering their data centers with <a href="https://www.cedara.io/post/tracking-the-transition-to-renewable-energy-in-the-data-center-industry">100%</a> 
        renewable energy between 2025 and 2030.</p>
        <p>In 2020, AWS reached <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/energy/transition1/">65%</a> of 
          renewable energy usage, and as of 2023, the company was matching 
          <a href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/products-services/aws-cloud">100%</a> of its electricity consumption 
          with renewable energy sources. Amazon is aiming to operate their data centers with 
          <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/migration-and-modernization/embracing-modernization-with-a-sustainability-focus/">100%</a> 
          renewable energy by 2025, with a target for net-zero status by 2040.</p>
        <p>Google's data centers have been <a href="https://sustainability.google/reports/environmental-report-2018/#renewable-energy">carbon neutral</a> 
          since 2007 and the company has been matching <a href="https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/cleanenergy/">100%</a> 
          of its annual electricity consumption with renewable energy purchases since 2017. Between 2019 and 2020,
          the share of renewable energy in Google's global electricity consumption increased from 61% to 
          <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/sustainability/the-year-in-carbon-free-energy-at-google">67%</a>.</p>
        <p>Microsoft's data centers have been <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/5/2018/04/MSFT.Map_.Final_3_28_18.pdf">carbon neutral</a>
            since 2012, and were relying on 50% renewable energy by 2018. By 2050, the company ambitions to remove from the atmosphere
            <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/sustainability-journey">all the carbon</a> it has emitted since its founding in 1975.</p>
        <p>Until all data centers are completely powered by renewable energy, sustainable software engineering practices
          can help product development teams maximize the reliance of the cloud applications they build on renewable energy sources.</p> 
        <p>Demand shifting, for instance, involves rescheduling or relocating computational tasks to take advantage of lower carbon 
          intensity at different times or locations. This strategy can be broken down into two types: spatial shifting and temporal 
          shifting. Spatial shifting means moving computations to regions where energy is cleaner, such as data centers powered by 
          renewable energy. Temporal shifting involves delaying tasks to times when the grid is less carbon-intensive, such as during 
          sunny or windy periods. For example, training machine learning models at night when wind energy is abundant or relocating workloads 
          to another hemisphere during peak solar seasons are both examples of demand shifting.</p>
        <p>Demand shaping, in contrast, refers to adapting computational workloads to align with the availability of low-carbon energy sources. 
          Instead of moving tasks to a different time or location, demand shaping involves increasing or decreasing application activities in 
          response to the current carbon intensity of the electricity grid. For instance, when the grid is powered predominantly by renewable energy, 
          applications can scale up and perform more energy-intensive tasks. Conversely, during periods of higher carbon intensity, applications can reduce 
          demand or prioritize essential processes. Examples of demand shaping include video conferencing software that adjusts streaming quality based on bandwidth 
          or energy efficiency, and eco modes in applications that sacrifice performance to reduce energy consumption automatically or with user consent.</p>

      <h2>The Immense Power of Sustainable Software Engineering</h2>
      <p>In February 2020, Danny Van Kooten published a blog post sharing how a simple decision in sustainable web design 
        led to remarkable environmental benefits. As a software developer, he optimized his WordPress plugin to remove unnecessary 
        JavaScript, reducing the data transferred with every page load on his website. This seemingly minor change had a significant 
        impact: by shrinking the size of his site, he cut energy consumption for visitors, leading to an estimated reduction of over 
        59,000 kilograms of CO2 emissions annually—equivalent to 85 transatlantic flights from New York to Amsterdam. Van Kooten’s story 
        demonstrates how thoughtful design choices can create substantial environmental gains, offering a compelling model for building 
        greener digital systems.</p>

      <h2>The Mirage of Digital Sobriety</h2>
      <p>Digital sobriety—the notion that reducing digital technology usage can significantly curb its environmental impact—overlooks 
        the profound connection between digital adoption and human progress. Strong correlations between metrics like the number of data 
        centers, internet connection speeds, and internet users with indicators such as the Human Development Index (HDI) and Gross Domestic 
        Product (GDP) underscore the transformative role of digital access in improving well-being and prosperity. Asking end users or developing 
        nations to scale back their usage not only risks stifling opportunities for knowledge and economic growth but also ignores the root problem: 
        the environmental footprint of computing lies primarily in how technology is produced, powered, and maintained. The solution, therefore, 
        is not to limit access but to accelerate the transition to cleaner, more efficient computing infrastructure that can sustainably meet the demand, 
        ensuring everyone can enjoy the immense benefits of the digital era.</p>
