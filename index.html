      <p>With the rapid growth of internet traffic in mind, you might wonder how this 
        has impacted the web's electricity consumption. The chart below compares the internet’s 
        energy use over time to that of G20 member countries, illustrating how the internet would rank

        account for 5% to 7% of global electricity use—a remarkable share for something so integral to modern life.
        What does this mean in terms of CO₂ emissions?</p>
      <p> While the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector is often highly praised for enabling 
        efficiencies that help reduce other sectors' footprint, it receives little attention as a contributor 
        itself to greenhouse gas emissions. The charts below show the evolution of the ICT sector's CO₂ emissions:</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095965261733233X" target="_blank">Belkhir and Elmeligi</a>, 
        between 2007 and 2020, the ICT sector’s share of global emissions more than doubled, rising from an estimated 1.06%-1.6% in 2007 
        to 3.06%-3.6% in 2020. This reflects the world’s increasing reliance on digital technology and infrastructure.</p>
      <p>By 2040, Belkhir and Elmeligi estimate that the ICT sector’s share of the global carbon footprint could range from 5.82% 
        under a linear trend to 14.57% if growth follows an exponential trajectory. Under that exponential scenario, ICT emissions would surpass 
        the relative footprint of agriculture (9%) and approach half the current footprint of the industrial sector (29%) in the United States. 
        These estimates assume global emissions stabilize at 2015 levels, in line with the Paris Agreement.</p>
        <p>If the exponential trend prevails, the ICT sector will become one of the largest contributors to global emissions. <span class="important-statement">This is the curve we want to bend.</span></p>

      <h2>Where Are Emissions Coming From?</h2>
      <p>To bend the curve of emissions from the ICT sector, we first need to understand what is causing 
        these emissions. Estimates of emissions in the ICT sector vary according to methodology, but experts converge 
        towards the idea that the main sources of emissions are data centers, networks, and user devices.</p>
      <p>These three pillars of modern digital ecosystems interact to deliver digital services, enabling data 
        transmission and processing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Data centers</strong> process, store, and manage vast amounts of data, consuming energy for computation, storage, 
          and cooling, often producing significant emissions if powered by non-renewable energy.</li>
        <li><strong>Networks</strong>, comprising wired and wireless infrastructure like fiber optics, routers, and cellular towers, 
          transmit data between devices and data centers. They consume energy for signal transmission and maintaining 
          connectivity, with emissions varying by network efficiency and energy grid.</li>
        <li><strong>User devices</strong> (e.g., smartphones, laptops) serve as endpoints for accessing and consuming content, 
          running applications, and interacting with services. They consume energy primarily for processing, 
          storage, and display, with emissions depending on their energy source.</li>        
      </ul>
      <p><a href="https://www.cell.com/patterns/pdfExtended/S2666-3899(21)00188-4" target="_blank">Andrae and Edler</a> estimate ICT emissions to be distributed as follows: </p>

    <section class="asset-block" id="ict-emissions-breakdown">
      <!-- Emissions breakdown chart will be inserted here -->
    </section>
    <section class="text-block">
      <p>Within each segment, we need to distinguish between two categories of emissions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Embodied emissions</strong> refer to the greenhouse gases produced during the manufacturing, transportation, and 
          installation of digital hardware, such as servers, devices, and network equipment.</li>
        <li><strong>Operational emissions</strong> are generated during the daily use of digital systems, including powering data centers, 
          networks, and user devices.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://sustainablewebdesign.org/estimating-digital-emissions/" target="_blank">Sustainable Web Design Model</a>, 
        embodied and operational emissions are distributed as follows:</p>

      <!-- Sustainable web design model chart will be inserted here -->
    </section>
    <section class="text-block">
      <p>As the charts above suggest, addressing embodied emissions is crucial, since these emissions are essentially "built into" 
        the physical infrastructure before it is used. However, as this pertains to the field of hardware manufacturing, it is outside 
        the direct scope of this article.</p>
        <p>In sustainable computing and software engineering, the focus is often on 
        reducing operational emissions because they are directly influenced by how we design, develop, and optimize 
        software and systems—such as improving energy efficiency, minimizing data transfer, and utilizing green energy 
        sources. Let's examine how we can decrease operational emission contributions of data centers, networks, and user devices.</p>

      <h2>The Promise of Renewable Energy</h2>
      <p>One of the main sources of operational emissions in the ICT sector is the energy consumption of data centers. One way to
        reduce the emissions of data centers is to power them with renewable energy sources. Fortunately, the trend
        is already moving in this direction. The largest cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud,
        and Microsoft Azure, have committed to powering their data centers with <a href="https://www.cedara.io/post/tracking-the-transition-to-renewable-energy-in-the-data-center-industry" target="_blank">100%</a> 
        renewable energy between 2025 and 2030:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>In 2020, AWS reached <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/energy/transition1/" target="_blank">65%</a> of 
            renewable energy usage, and as of 2023, the company was matching 
            <a href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/products-services/aws-cloud" target="_blank">100%</a> of its electricity consumption 
            with renewable energy sources. Amazon is aiming to operate their data centers with 
            <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/migration-and-modernization/embracing-modernization-with-a-sustainability-focus/" target="_blank">100%</a> 
            renewable energy by 2025, with a target for net-zero status by 2040.</li>
          <li>Google's data centers have been <a href="https://sustainability.google/reports/environmental-report-2018/#renewable-energy" target="_blank">carbon neutral</a> 
            since 2007 and the company has been matching <a href="https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/cleanenergy/" target="_blank">100%</a> 
            of its annual electricity consumption with renewable energy purchases since 2017. Between 2019 and 2020,
            the share of renewable energy in Google's global electricity consumption increased from 61% to 
            <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/sustainability/the-year-in-carbon-free-energy-at-google" target="_blank">67%</a>.</li>
          <li>Microsoft's data centers have been <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/5/2018/04/MSFT.Map_.Final_3_28_18.pdf" target="_blank">carbon neutral</a>
              since 2012, and were relying on 50% renewable energy by 2018. By 2050, the company ambitions to remove from the atmosphere
              <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/sustainability-journey" target="_blank">all the carbon</a> it has emitted since its founding in 1975.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Until all data centers are completely powered by renewable energy, sustainable software engineering practices
          can help product development teams maximize the reliance of the cloud applications they build on renewable energy sources.
          To that effect, the Linux Foundation's <a href="https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/green-software-for-practitioners-lfc131/" target="_blank">Green Software for Practitioners</a>
          certification advocates two fundamental carbon-awareness approaches, to make software do more when the carbon intensity of computing is lower.</p>
        <p class="image-title">Computational Load Optimization Based on Carbon Intensity</p>
        <img src="assets/images/computational_load_optimization.svg" alt="Computational Load Optimization.svg">
        <p><strong>Demand shifting</strong>, on the one hand, involves rescheduling or relocating computational tasks to take advantage of lower carbon 
          intensity at different times or locations. This strategy can be broken down into two types: spatial shifting and temporal 
          shifting. Spatial shifting means moving computations to regions where energy is cleaner, such as data centers powered by 
          renewable energy. Temporal shifting involves delaying tasks to times when the grid is less carbon-intensive, such as during 
          sunny or windy periods. Training machine learning models at night when wind energy is abundant or relocating workloads 
          to another hemisphere during peak solar seasons are both examples of demand shifting. Anne Currie, co-author of 
          <em><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-green-software/9781098150617/" target="_blank">Building Green Software</a></em>, 
          and a leading voice in sustainable computing, told me:</p>
          <blockquote>LLM training is a great example of what the Texan grid refers to as a Large Flexible Load, i.e. a load that is latency insensitive 
            and could therefore be aligned with solar or wind generation. Even inference could be done in this way using pre-calculation and caching.</blockquote>
        <p><strong>Demand shaping</strong>, on the other hand, refers to adapting computational workloads to align with the availability of low-carbon energy sources. 
          Instead of moving tasks to a different time or location, demand shaping involves increasing or decreasing application activities in 
          response to the current carbon intensity of the electricity grid. For instance, when the grid is powered predominantly by renewable energy, 
          applications can scale up and perform more energy-intensive tasks. Conversely, during periods of higher carbon intensity, applications can reduce 
          demand or prioritize essential processes. Examples of demand shaping include video conferencing software that adjusts streaming quality based on bandwidth 
          or energy efficiency, and eco modes in applications that sacrifice performance to reduce energy consumption automatically or with user consent.</p>

      <h2>Efficiency, The Cornerstone of Sustainability</h2>
      <p>Dr. Sadasivan Shankar is Research Technology Manager at <a href="https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">SLAC National Laboratory</a>, 
        Adjunct Professor in Stanford Materials Science and Engineering, and Lecturer in the Stanford Graduate School of Business.
        His current <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.17331" target="_blank">research</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07516" target="_blank">analysis</a> on sustainable computing is helping provide directions for the US Department of Energy’s 
        EES2 scaling initiative, which aims to enhance the energy efficiency of semiconductor applications by a factor of 1,000 over the next 20 years.
        Dr. Shankar argues:</p>
      <blockquote>Even if the entire ICT sector were powered by renewable energy, the industry’s exponential growth 
        means efficiency would still be critical.</blockquote>
      <p>Without significant improvements in how energy is used, 
        the sector risks consuming an outsized share of clean energy resources that are also essential for 
        other sectors and societal needs. </p>
      <p>One key metric used to measure data center energy efficiency is Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE). 
        Developed by <a href="https://www.thegreengrid.org/en/resources/library-and-tools/217-PUE" target="_blank">The Green Grid</a> in 2006, 
        PUE compares the total energy consumption of a data center to the energy 
        used solely by its computing equipment. A PUE of 1.0 indicates that all energy is used for computing, 
        with no additional overhead for cooling or power distribution. In contrast, if an application consumes 10 kWh 
        of energy and the data center’s PUE is 1.5, the actual energy drawn from the grid is 15 kWh—10 kWh for computing 
        and 5 kWh for operational overhead like cooling and power delivery.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, PUE has <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1229367/data-center-average-annual-pue-worldwide/" target="_blank">improved significantly</a> over the years. In 2007, the global average PUE was around 2.5, 
        meaning that data centers consumed 1.5 watts in overhead for every watt used by computing equipment. By 2020, 
        global PUE had dropped to under 1.6, thanks to advancements in IT hardware, more efficient cooling technologies, 
        and a shift towards hyperscale cloud data centers that are far more efficient than smaller enterprise facilities.</p>
        <p>This progress has been instrumental in keeping global data center electricity consumption 
          <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/global-trends-in-internet-traffic-data-centres-workloads-and-data-centre-energy-use-2010-2020" target="_blank">relatively flat</a>
           despite the exponential growth of internet traffic and workloads. For example, while internet traffic grew by a factor of 
        20 between 2010 and 2020, data center electricity use only increased moderately, stabilizing at an estimated 
        240-340 TWh in 2022, or roughly 1-1.3% of global electricity demand.</p>
      <div class="guideline">
        <p>To understand the impact of PUE on energy consumption more deeply, explore the interactive charts below. The first chart 
        illustrates the worldwide average annual PUE of data centers from 2010 to 2050, while the second shows 
        <a href="https://thundersaidenergy.com/downloads/internet-energy-consumpion-data-models-forecasts/" target="_blank">global data center 
          electricity consumption</a> over the same period, including the energy used by blockchains and AI. By adjusting the PUE values in the first chart, 
        you can see how efficiency improvements could shape energy consumption in the second chart.</p>

      <p>These visualizations highlight both the achievements made so far and the critical importance of further reducing PUE over 
        the long term to limit energy consumption as the ICT sector continues to grow. To achieve this, let's consider the factors 
        that influence PUE, including how data centers manage energy-intensive processes like cooling.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="text-block">

      <h2>Taking The Heat—And Giving It Back</h2>
      <p>A data center functions as a vast collection of information processing engines—servers—designed to perform complex computational tasks. 
        Fundamentally, computing is the act of flipping bits—a physical process that requires and converts energy. Each server takes in electromagnetic energy 
        as electricity, which powers its operations. This energy is then transformed into two outputs: information processing, the intended result, and heat energy, 
        an inevitable byproduct.</p>
        <p class="image-title">Energy Conversion Flow of an Information Processing Engine</p>
      <img src="assets/images/information_processing_engine.svg" alt="Information processing Engine">
      <p>Innovation in overhead efficiency, particularly in cooling systems, plays a critical role in improving PUE by ensuring a larger proportion 
        of a data center's energy consumption is allocated to computing rather than managing heat. Cutting-edge solutions such as advanced liquid cooling, 
        optimized airflow designs, and energy-efficient pumps have already demonstrated their potential to reduce cooling demands significantly. As organizations 
        aim to lower their PUE, such innovations represent a vital path forward for sustainable operations.</p>
      <p>But what about the heat that data centers inescapably produce? Waste heat, rather than being discarded, can become a valuable resource. For instance, 
        data centers can <a href="https://www.iea.org/energy-system/buildings/data-centres-and-data-transmission-networks" target="_blank">repurpose excess heat</a> to warm nearby 
        residential or commercial buildings or support industrial processes, reducing reliance on other energy sources. 
        If implemented effectively, waste heat management could even contribute to a dramatic reduction in Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE).</p>
      <p>In theory, a data center that makes full use of its waste heat could achieve a PUE closer to—if not below—the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_usage_effectiveness" target="_blank">theoretical threshold</a>
         of 1.0, as the energy consumed would serve dual purposes: powering computing operations and providing useful heat for external needs. Although such an idea would 
         require additional innovation, notably to reduce the noise of server cooling systems through adequate materials and technology, this underscores the transformative potential 
         of waste heat as a key element in building more sustainable digital infrastructure.</p>
      <p>Looking beyond hardware, optimizing the software that powers data centers offers another critical avenue for improvement. Rust, for example, is a programming 
        language known for its efficiency, with <a href="https://greenlab.di.uminho.pt/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sleFinal.pdf" target="_blank">studies</a> showing it can halve electricity 
        consumption compared to Java, a common language in cloud computing. Shane Miller, 
        a leader in the Rust community, notes that this <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/02/14/1067869/rust-worlds-fastest-growing-programming-language/" target="_blank">level of efficiency</a> 
        could enable data centers to double their current workloads or perform the same tasks in facilities half the size.</p>
      <p>This creates a dual opportunity: by locating these mini data centers in urban areas—such as in the basements of residential or commercial buildings—they may be positioned closer to both heat consumers 
        and data consumers. This proximity allows for more practical reuse of waste heat, while also reducing the network footprint—by minimizing the resources required to transmit 
        heat and data, respectively, over long distances. These combined benefits hint at the transformative potential of sustainable software practices in addressing energy challenges.</p>

      <h2>The Immense Potential of Sustainable Software Engineering</h2>
      <p>In February 2020, Danny van Kooten, a software developer, published a <a href="https://www.dannyvankooten.com/blog/2020/website-carbon-emissions/" target="_blank">blog post</a> 
        highlighting how a small change in sustainable web design could deliver remarkable environmental benefits. While refactoring his popular Mailchimp for WordPress plugin, 
        he reduced the amount of data sent to the browser on every visit by <em>just</em> 20 KB.</p>
      <p>Given that over two million websites use the plugin, this seemingly minor update led to 
        an estimated reduction of the world’s monthly CO₂ output by 59,000 kilograms—roughly the 
        equivalent of 85 transatlantic flights from New York to Amsterdam and back. This story 
        underscores how thoughtful, data-driven design choices can have an outsized positive impact, 
        serving as a model for building greener digital systems. In the words of Mr. van Kooten:</p>
        <blockquote>
          "There's no way I can have that kind of effect in other areas of my life."
        </blockquote>
      <p>Mr. van Kooten’s story also reflects the broader principles of sustainable web design, which focus on minimizing the energy and resources 
        required to build, run, and access digital services. Experts like <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/sustainable-web-design.html" target="_blank">Tom Greenwood</a>, 
        <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-for-sustainability/9781491935767/" target="_blank">Tim Frick</a>, 
        and <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-green-software/9781098150617/" target="_blank">Anne Currie</a> have outlined key practices 
        for sustainable digital systems that help reduce emissions across data centers, networks, and user devices:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Prioritize simplicity and efficiency:</strong> Reducing unnecessary features, files, and code minimizes energy consumption 
          across all three areas by decreasing processing demands, lowering network data transfer, and reducing energy usage on devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Design for performance:</strong> Optimizing load times and minimizing data transfer directly reduces emissions from networks 
          and user devices, as smaller data loads require less energy for transmission and processing.</li>
        <li><strong>Leverage green hosting:</strong> Choosing hosting providers powered by renewable energy targets data center emissions, 
          significantly reducing their carbon footprint.</li>
        <li><strong>Adopt user-centric sustainability:</strong> Building interfaces and features that encourage environmentally conscious behavior 
          can reduce emissions from user devices, such as by promoting power-saving modes or reducing the need for frequent updates.</li>
        <li><strong>Extend system lifespans:</strong> Designing software and digital tools to remain functional longer helps reduce embodied emissions 
          from manufacturing user devices and hardware while curbing waste.</li>
        <li><strong>Measure and optimize continuously:</strong> Tools to measure the environmental impact of digital services enable improvements across 
          data centers, networks, and user devices, ensuring a holistic approach to sustainability.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While building the website for this article, I aimed to follow sustainable web design best practices wherever possible. For example, 
        I chose a black background and green accents, as these colors consume less energy on user devices by minimizing screen pixel illumination. 
        I also opted for lightweight visuals in SVG format, which require less data transmission than larger file types, and limited the imported libraries 
        to essentials like D3 for charts. However, this is a work in progress—I could further optimize by compacting the CSS stylesheet and switching to a 
        hosting provider powered by renewable energy, as GitHub Pages currently does not offer this option.</p>
      <p>These principles highlight how sustainable web design can reduce emissions at every stage of digital infrastructure. 
        Whether through optimizing software or selecting renewable-powered data centers, these strategies empower developers to make a meaningful 
        impact on the environment. But how can we start assessing emissions from software, and how do we measure progress toward long-term sustainability?</p>

      <h2>What Gets Measured, Gets Managed</h2>
      <p>Advances in measurement tools are essential for driving change, as Ms. Currie emphasizes the importance of incorporating performance testing into software development practices. 
        She highlights the need to understand what aspects of an application are fast or slow and the reasons behind their performance. In particular, 
        she urges developers to evaluate the value of API calls, noting that they are CPU-intensive and represent an investment in energy and, often, carbon. 
        By questioning the necessity and efficiency of these operations, engineers can make more sustainable choices in their designs.</p>
      <p>For those with technical expertise, the <a href="https://if.greensoftware.foundation/" target="_blank">Impact Framework</a> from the Green Software Foundation 
        provides an <a href="https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/if" target="_blank">open-source toolkit</a>
        to measure and manage the environmental impact of software. Designed for software engineering teams, this framework offers 
        detailed methodologies and tools to analyze carbon emissions and optimize resource usage.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Dr. Shankar’s lab at Stanford University 
        is developing a tool to facilitate the measurement of software sustainability. This pioneer initiative reflects growing academic interest in empowering 
        developers with actionable insights to reduce digital emissions.</p>
      <p>For individuals and organizations, tools like <a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/" target="_blank">Website Carbon</a> and <a href="https://ecograder.com/" target="_blank">EcoGrader</a> offer a practical way to assess the sustainability of any website. By analyzing 
        factors like data transfer size, hosting energy source, and user traffic, these tools provide actionable insights to help you reduce your digital carbon footprint.
        For example, you can assess the carbon rating of this very website <a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/letsbendthecurve-com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
      <p>The potential impact of sustainable software engineering becomes staggering when scaled across major organizations. Take the websites of Fortune 500 companies as an example. 
        By calculating the grams of CO₂ emitted per visit using data from Website Carbon and scaling this based on each site's traffic from SimilarWeb, 
        we can estimate that 492 of these companies collectively emit 105,877 tonnes of CO₂ annually. This is equivalent to the emissions of over 
        <span class="data-point" title="A typical passenger vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons of CO2 per year.">23,000</span> passenger cars driven for an entire year.</p>
      <div class="guideline">
        <p>The interactive chart below allows you to explore the annual CO₂ emissions from these companies' websites. The size of each rectangle
        represents the emissions of the company's website. You can mouse hover over each rectangle to reveal additional details about the associated company.
        You can also refine the selection of companies included in the chart with the filters provided below the chart.</p>

      <p>By now, we have explored numerous strategies to reduce emissions from data centers, networks, and user devices, primarily 
        through engineering innovations. this raises an important question: what role can users play in mitigating the environmental impact 
        of digital technology? Is changing how we use these services as effective as improving how they are designed and operated?</p>

      <h2>The Subtle Tradeoffs of Digital Sobriety</h2>
      <p>Digital sobriety—the idea that reducing our use of digital technology can help mitigate its environmental 
        impact—offers an intuitive path to sustainability. On the surface, fewer video calls, emails, and streamed gaming sessions 
        seem like they would lead to less data transmission, lower energy consumption, and reduced emissions. Beyond sustainability, 
        cutting back on digital usage can have other personal benefits: <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6214874/" target="_blank">studies</a> 
        show that limiting screen time can improve mental health, enhance sleep quality, and boost overall well-being</p>
      <p>However, experts in sustainability take a more nuanced view. While digital sobriety may offer benefits in certain contexts, 
        it also involves tradeoffs. As Dr. Shankar points out, computer usage is strongly correlated with societal indicators like GDP and 
        the Human Development Index (HDI). Wider access to digital technologies has transformed education, healthcare, 
        and economic opportunities, lifting millions out of poverty and improving overall well-being.</p>
      <div class="guideline">
        <p>The series of six charts below highlights these correlations, illustrating how digitalization has become a cornerstone of progress.
        On each chart, each dot represents a country: you can hover with your mouse over each dot to reveal the associated country's name and data.

      <p>This perspective shifts the focus from individual digital habits to broader systemic solutions. 
        Mr. Frick emphasizes that personal responsibility should certainly be encouraged.
        However, to effectively transition to a circular economy and meaningfully address emissions, he also argue that we need 
        Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), mandatory climate disclosures, and related laws to incentivize 
        better behavior and hold corporations accountable. This resonates with what Asim Hussain, Executive Director
        of the <a href="https://greensoftware.foundation/" target="_blank">Green Software Foundation</a>, told me:</p>
      <blockquote>        
        “An interesting perspective is to guide corporations into making carbon-neutral digital services, 
        rather than expecting end users to reduce their usage. Ideally, video calls will produce fewer emissions, 
        not because we are placing fewer of those, but because they simply do not emit greenhouse gases in the first place.”
      </blockquote>
      <p>These viewpoints emphasize the critical role of policy and corporate responsibility in tackling the environmental footprint 
        of digital technology. Rather than scaling back digital usage, a more effective approach may be to embrace digitalization while 
        focusing on making it cleaner and more efficient. Riding the wave of digital transformation—embracing the growing reliance on digital 
        services—allows sustainability efforts to align with existing behavioral trends rather than resist them. This approach also preserves 
        the broader, tangible benefits of digitalization, such as reducing emissions in other sectors</p>
      <p>By supporting a sustainable transition, we can work toward a future where computing is not an expensive, carbon-emitting privilege for the few—but 
        a clean, affordable, and accessible opportunity for all. However, could greater efficiency in digital technology unintentionally backfire, 
        leading to even higher emissions as usage increases?</p>

      <h2>The Paradox of The Jevons Paradox</h2>
      <p>The Jevons Paradox originates from the 19th-century observation that increasing the efficiency of coal use led to a <em>rise</em> in total coal consumption. 
        Applied to computing, the fear is that making digital services more sustainable and efficient will encourage greater usage, potentially negating the 
        environmental benefits.</p>
      <p>Mr. Hussain challenges that assumption. He emphasizes that the software most consumed is often the cheapest, most addictive, and most profitable—not 
        necessarily the most efficient or environmentally friendly. To the best of his knowledge, there is no 
        evidence to prove that making software more efficient will lead to higher emissions.
      </p>
      <p>Dr. Shankar provides a compelling perspective on this issue: what matters is achieving a net positive trade-off. 
        By analogy, he explains that if we extend human longevity, some people will use their additional years for good, and others for bad. 
        Yet the net result—more years for meaningful contributions—is overwhelmingly positive, which is why we pursue it.</p>
        <p>The same logic applies to sustainability in computing. Making digital technology more efficient might increase usage, 
        but it will also amplify the positive outcomes—greater access to education, healthcare, and innovation. Dr. Shankar adds:</p>
      <blockquote>
        "Too much of a good thing is better than too little. The alternative—inefficient, high-emissions computing—would be far worse,
        and that is what we must avoid. Our goal is to make computing so efficient that, even if the entire world uses it tomorrow, 
        it still consumes less energy than today."
      </blockquote>
      <p>Rather than fearing increased efficiency, the focus should be on designing digital systems that are both efficient and sustainable, 
        enabling global access while minimizing energy use. As Dr. Shankar and Mr. Hussain both argue, efficiency in computing represents an 
        opportunity to achieve a net positive impact—providing essential services to a growing population without exceeding planetary boundaries.</p>

      <h2>Let's Bend The Curve</h2>
      <p>Digital services have transformed the way we live, work, and connect—but they come with an environmental footprint that is far from negligible. 
        While the emissions from individual activities like emails or streaming may seem small, they add up significantly when scaled across billions of users. 
        As the internet and the ICT sector continue to grow at an unprecedented pace, we find ourselves on unsustainable trajectories that demand urgent attention.</p>
      <p>Given how deeply digital services are woven into modern life, expecting an absolute decrease in usage is neither realistic nor desirable. Digitalization drives 
        societal progress, offering opportunities for education, innovation, and economic growth while helping to reduce emissions in other industries through smarter logistics, 
        virtual collaboration, and resource optimization. Rather than scaling back, the goal should be to ensure that digital growth is both inclusive and sustainable.</p>
      <p>The key lies in fostering innovation to make digital services cleaner and more efficient. By improving energy use in data centers, networks, and user devices, 
        and by adopting principles of sustainable software engineering, we can work toward a future where computing is accessible to everyone—at a fraction of today’s emissions. 
        The challenge is immense, but so is the opportunity.</p>
      <p>If we all join forces—as engineers, policymakers, and end users—to prioritize efficiency and sustainability in the technology industry, there is no doubt we can meet 
        the world’s growing computing needs in an environmentally-friendly manner. Let's create a digital future that benefits everyone and the planet we call home.
