# Let's Bend The Curve

[Let's Bend The Curve](https://www.letsbendthecurve.com/) is a visual explainer article developed by Thibaud Clement (@thibaudclement) as part of Stanford's CS448B course (Final Project).

## Project Background

In 2021, the software startup I had co-founded six years earlier was experiencing exponential growth. This required scaling up our cloud infrastructure, which, in turn, increased its environmental footprint. Concerned about the ecological impact of our work, I began exploring ways to mitigate this effect and discovered the emerging field of sustainable computing and software engineering. This interest has since become a focus of my professional and academic journey.

Although I am a self-taught programmer, my formal academic background is in management. To bridge the gap and contribute effectively to sustainable solutions for the growing demands of the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector, I started pursuing foundational computer science coursework at Stanford. This quarter, alongside _CS448B: Data Visualization_, I attended the _Stanford Energy Seminar_ to deepen my understanding of sustainability challenges and opportunities in technology. This project integrates my prior experience with additional research and interviews conducted specifically for this visual explainer.

_Let’s Bend the Curve_ draws its name from the exponential trajectory of the ICT sector’s environmental impact, which we aim to curb. The article, _Sustainability in the Computing Age: Addressing the Environmental Impact of Digital Technology_, seeks to raise awareness of the unsustainable trends in digital technology while presenting actionable solutions and fostering innovation in sustainable computing to meet industry demands in an environmentally responsible way.

## Target Audience

This visual explainer is designed to be accessible to a general audience, requiring no prior technical knowledge. While it aims to engage a broad readership, it also targets three specific sub-audiences, each with complementary goals:

1. **End Users:** The explainer seeks to raise awareness among digital service users about the environmental footprint of technology. The goal is not to discourage usage but to foster an understanding that manipulating digital information carries an environmental cost, even if it is not immediately visible.

2. **Software Engineers:** The explainer aims to highlight the significant impact technical decisions can have on sustainability. It identifies low-hanging fruit and illustrates how the scalability of software and the power of innovation can play an effective role in the energy transition and combating climate change.

3. **Government Officials and Policymakers:** The explainer provides insights into the sources of emissions in the digital technology sector. It outlines how strategic nudges, incentives, and regulations can shape the industry’s future toward a lower carbon footprint.

## Platform Choice

Building on the experience gained during _Assignment 3_, this project was developed as a custom static site using HTML, SVG, CSS, and JavaScript, hosted on GitHub Pages. This approach provided the flexibility needed to seamlessly integrate the chart and text elements of the article, streamlined code versioning, and enabled the use of custom domain names (`letsbendthecurve.com` and `computingsustainability.com`).

## Design Decisions

### Background & Text Colors

The most immediately striking design decision in this project is the use of a dark background—specifically black. This choice is not a "dark mode" feature but rather an application of sustainable web design principles outlined in the article. A black background with green accents reduces energy consumption on user devices by minimizing screen pixel illumination.

To complement the dark background, I selected a light gray text color (`#bcbec0`) instead of white, as it improves readability and reduces eye strain for readers.

### Color Palette

The initial color palette drew inspiration from Color Brewer, utilizing a sequential, multi-hue scheme:
- `#ffffcc`
- `#c2e699`
- `#78c679`
- `#31a354`
- `#006837`

This palette was extended for the Fortune 500 chart to include seven distinct shades representing Website Carbon grades (A+ to F), ranging from green to black:
- `#78c679`
- `#41ab5d`
- `#238443`
- `#006837`
- `#004529`
- `#002a18`
- `#000000`

Additionally, the following shades of gray were used throughout the article where necessary:
- `#ffffff`
- `#f1f2f2`
- `#e6e7e8`
- `#d1d3d4`
- `#bcbec0`
- `#a7a9ac`
- `#939598`
- `#808285`
- `#6d6e71`
- `#58595b`
- `#414042`
- `#000000`

### Layout and Typography

Inspired by the formatting and aspect ratio of this _New York Times_ [visualization](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/04/29/upshot/money-race-and-success-how-your-school-district-compares.html), I opted for full-width charts as they are central to the explainer. In contrast, the text is presented in a narrow, centered column for readability. The font size is set at `18px` with a line height of `1.6` to enhance legibility.

### Interactive and Styling Features

Additional design elements include:
- Hover effects for in-text data points to display supplementary information.
- Clear guidelines for using the interactive charts included in the article.
- Stylized quotes from experts in sustainable computing to highlight key insights.

### Charts

Several design decisions were made to enhance the clarity and effectiveness of specific charts in the visual explainer:
- **Weekly Emissions Chart:** After careful consideration, I opted for a logarithmic scale on the y-axis. While a linear scale might have been more straightforward for a general audience, the wide range of values made smaller data points difficult to distinguish. Since the chart's primary goal is to emphasize that the bars do not represent zero values rather than highlight the differences between them, a logarithmic scale better served this purpose by making smaller values more visible.
- **Guiding User Attention:** Feedback from the Week 10 Review Session highlighted the importance of guiding viewers to understand the charts and focus on key elements. The following decisions align with this feedback:
  - In the _Global Internet Users from 2000 to 2024_ chart, an annotation highlights the year when the curve begins to plateau.
  - For the _Global Internet Traffic from 2000 to 2024_ chart, a hint is provided as an annotation to assist viewers in interpreting the data.
  - In the _Electricity Consumption of The Internet vs. G20 Countries from 2010 to 2022_ chart, the bar representing the internet is colored differently from the others to draw attention to this specific data point.
  - In the _ICT Sector Emissions as a Percentage of Global Emissions_ duo of charts, the _Modeled Projections (2021-2040)_ chart features an annotation reading "Let’s Bend The Curve," reinforcing the article’s central call to action and highlighting this critical trend.
  - In the _Worldwide Data Center Average Annual Power Usage Effectiveness (2010-2050)_ chart, a vertical white dashed line separates past and projected data, while a horizontal green dashed line marks the theoretical 1.0 threshold for the PUE indicator. This threshold represents the ideal target, with the aim of eventually surpassing it through disruptive innovation.
- **Exploration in the Fortune 500 Chart:** For the Fortune 500 chart, I intentionally avoided adding guides, to allow viewers to independently explore the extensive dataset, applying insights gained throughout the article to form their own hypotheses and conclusions. Additionally, the chart title is dynamic, updating in real time to reflect the number of companies and the total tonnes of CO2 based on the filters applied in the controls section.
- **Trend Lines:** In the series of six charts on digital prosperity, towards the end of the article, trend lines were included to highlight the relationships being emphasized. While a straight trend line on a logarithmic scale indicates an exponential trend, I chose not to explicitly explain this to avoid introducing unnecessary noise in the charts' interpretation.

## Development Process

The project required approximately 120 hours to complete and involved the following phases:
- **Project Proposal (6 hours):** Conducted initial research on available datasets related to computing, benchmarked inspiring visualization projects, outlined the article, and drafted the project proposal.
- **Data Sourcing & Wrangling (32 hours):** Performed detailed research on datasets and wrangled data for the project. Enriching an existing dataset about Fortune 500 companies (containing public information) with data from Website Carbon and Similarweb to create the `fortune_500_websites_emissions.csv` dataset was particularly time-consuming, requiring two full-time days of work.
- **Expert Interviews (7 hours):** Reached out to experts in the field (Dr. Sadasivan Shankar, Tim Frick, Asim Hussain, Anne Currie, and Tom Greenwood), prepared and conducted interviews, and processed the resulting notes.
- **GitHub Pages Setup (3 hours):** Purchased domain names (`letsbendthecurve.com` and `computingsustainability.com`), initialized this GitHub [repository](https://github.com/thibaudclement/letsbendthecurve), and configured GitHub Pages with custom domains.
- **Website Design (6 hours):** Established the project’s basic repository structure, made key design decisions (e.g. font and color palette), and built the main page layout.
- **Chart Design (40 hours):** Designed and implemented 18 charts using D3, along with interactive controls where appropriate.
- **Writing (8 hours):** Refined the article’s narrative, created a detailed outline, and drafted the text based on insights from charts and interviews.
- **Testing & Debugging (4 hours):** Performed quality assurance and fixed bugs to ensure the project functioned as intended. Most of the debugging and fixing time was spent resolving challenges in the controls and filtering systems of the Fortune 500 chart.
- **Final Touches (7 hours):** Proofread the text, updated colors for consistency, and made minor adjustments to charts.
- **Video Recording (5 hours):** Produced a 2-minute video demo featuring a voiceover to explain the project, showcase interactions in the visualizations, and describe key findings.
- **README Draft (2 hours):** Documented the project in this README file.

## Future Developments

This project is due on December 8, 2024, after which all development efforts will pause until grading is complete. Once the project has been evaluated, I plan to explore the following improvements:
- **Responsive Design:** Adapt the layout for mobile devices and optimize user interactions for touchscreen interfaces, improving the experience on smartphones and tablets where mouse hovering is unavailable.
- **Tooltip Refinement:** Replace native tooltips in in-text data points with CSS-based tooltips for faster and smoother display of additional information.
- **Text-Chart Interactions:** Introduce synchronized hover effects between text and charts, enabling users to highlight related elements in the text and visualizations simultaneously.
- **Lazy Loading:** Implement lazy loading of sections to make the explainer more dynamic and improve performance as users scroll through the page.
- **Reference Section:** Add a comprehensive list of relevant resources at the bottom of the article for reference and further reading—in addition to all links already included in the text of the article.
- **Real-Time Data Integration:** Connect the project to the [Website Carbon API](https://www.websitecarbon.com/api/) and live data about Fortune 500 companies to ensure the article stays up to date with the latest information.
- **User Guide:** Include a simple, collapsible guide to help users navigate the article, such as explanations of color coding and interactive features.
